# Verbose GC Log Visualizer for GraalVM Native Image

When executing a native image, the options `-XX:+VerboseGC -XX:+PrintGCTimes -XX:+TraceHeapChunks -XX:+PrintHeapShape`
can be used to print detailed information on garbage collection.

The goal of this Project is to graphically visualize and digest the verbose output and, ultimately,
make it easier to understand for users.

- GC timers are shown in charts
- Chunk assignment to generations (young, old) and spaces (eden, survivor, tenured)
- Chunk tracing (changes to top pointer and affiliation over time)

**Example log entry:**

## Getting Started

**Step 0:** Run your GraalVM Native Image application with the mentioned verbose GC log flags. \
Here are the commands I used during the presentation:

```
docker run -it --entrypoint sh -v ${PWD}:/demo ghcr.io/graalvm/native-image:22.3.2

cd /demo

javac HelloWorld.java

native-image HelloWorld

./helloworld -XX:+VerboseGC -XX:+PrintGCTimes -XX:+TraceHeapChunks -XX:+PrintHeapShape 2> log.txt
```

**Step 1:** Select a log file to load by clicking in the middle of the application.

![Screenshot - File Select](screenshots/select-file.png)

**Step 2:** After the log file has been parsed, you'll get to the overview screen. \
It mainly shows all the different timers that were included in the log output.

**Step 3:** For more details about a particular garbage collection run, click one of the epoch entries in the sidebar.

**Step 4:** The history of a particular chunk can be viewed by clicking on the clock rewind icon.
